# lem-config - Lem IDE Configuration

Modular configuration for Lem (Common Lisp Editor/IDE).

This configuration is set up as its own Common Lisp system `:lem-config`!

A cool feature is the system is loaded in such a way to fail *quietly* and
and generates `*.log` files in `lem/logs/` (each log entry is timestamped): 
- `config-error.log` lists any issues encounted upon loading, and
- `config-startup.log` lists successful startup


- `init.lisp`      --> User init loaded by lem, sets up ASDF's registry and loads `:lem-config` system
- `lem-config.asd` --> System definition for this configuration
- `source/`        --> Contains souce files for this configuration
- `assets/`        --> Where images, lem.desktop, and related stuff are held
- `extensions/`    --> WIP where lem extension systems will be held

## TODOs (Wish List)

  - Build out more personal keybindings
  - Fix bug in `fp-up-directory` function, hangs on some special chars.
  - Configure `C-x k` to actually kill the current buffer/file
  - Build an extension analogous to Emacs' erc-mode
